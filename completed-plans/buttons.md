clicking the ctrl-n and ctrl-p icons should each do the right thing on the main screen. I know it's just a small thing, but it's a nice touch. make sure separate actions for each, one should go up the other down.
And make the clickable things look clickable on hover using an underline, just like we did for the button to :x save and quit in vim mode.

Make image editing actually work. When I do Ctrl E on an image, it opens up in Preview app (good), but when I save it in Preview App, I don't see the change inside our application (bad, should show up).

Also: the image should show up much larger when we edit: use screen real estate more effectively. Currently I have to shove my head up to the monitor and really squint to be able to see anything. An inspiration here is when somebody presses spacebar on something in Finder, it's super big. Don't actually use spacebar since that's used for search. However, tab should show a similar function. We should really have to do that. Take advantage of the screen real estate and give the user a nice view. They can always press escape or press tab again in order to make something small.

Don't change the positions of anything, but make help keyboard-navigable (while ensuring a11y and i18n). 
Make navigation like vim help navigation and have the bar at the bottom remind about the keybindings. Enter should follow links though (but ctrl-] or whatever vim does should also quietly be supported as a secret alias).

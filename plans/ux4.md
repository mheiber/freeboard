For multimedia things like screenshots, which are commonly on my clipboard. One of my workflows for screenshots is to go through and edit using preview tools. Or using whatever that thing that automatically is used to edit screenshots when you double-click before the screenshot is saved. It would be kind of nice if for screenshots specifically, at least, we allowed tweaking using the control-E to edit. Menu. It would also be pretty neat if we allowed editing music and video by at least cropping. Or perhaps by just opening up the thing in a temporary file for whatever the native editor for that thing is. If we go the direction of opening up the native editor, which I think is probably best, we would also probably want some open width. Flow. But maybe not because I'm not quite sure where we could put open with. This is all fairly experimental. So, in your commit message, I really want you to include a detailed discussion of the trade-offs and different options that we could have gone with instead

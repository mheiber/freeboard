We want to put a lot of compute at evaluating the app overall, thinking about the functionality as a whole, thinking about common user workflows. Our target developers are people like project managers. Coders, people who use dictation and screenshots heavily, people who are copy-pasting code and commit messages and filling out password forms. Kind of stuff. Is there anything else that they might want from a clipboard manager? I want you to use a team of creative people to bounce around ideas and really think this through, or maybe use some sub-agents. I want you to come up with a summary of what. The values of our application are and write them to a markdown file called values.md, commit the markdown file, and then add more of your own plans to the plans markdown folder and then start iterating through the plans. Because these are invented by machines rather than for humans, the commit messages will need to be highly descriptive as to the intent behind the change. How it accords with our values and design. Don't sacrifice simplicity for the user: the app should be self-explanatory and easy to use and any complexity has to be hidden or features just simply not done Because there's no simple way to do them.. I need you to make sure that work is done by sub-agents and that you end the sub-agent if the sub-agent is stuck asking for permissions. Away, and I won't be able to give permissions for anything. I want all the work to either be done or for it to be documented why it didn't fit into the overall design for the app.

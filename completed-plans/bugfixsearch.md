Fix the following bug. What happens is that if I have a a few items in my clipboard and then start typing something and then I press CtrlN, CtrlN, and then I press back. Backspace, then I expect backspace to actually work. Sorry, I mean the delete key on Mac, which I also think of as backspace. I expect the delete key to work, however, it does not actually delete any characters. Instead, I hear the sound that the Mac makes. When a key press is not accepted, it seems that pressing CtrlN and Ctrl-P loses the focus, which is fine, but you probably want. Put the focus back when the user is typing something or when the user is pressing delete or backspace. Delete our backspace. Should always delete our backspace inside the search bar no matter what.

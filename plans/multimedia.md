Support copy/pasting not just text but other forms of media as well, such as images and audio. 
Have nice previews for these as well, not just text previews.
Note that "edit" won't work for non-text things.

Steps (use subagents liberally to save context):
- form hypotheses about best user experience
- research how other clipboard managers do it - that's not necessarily best, but can help bounce ideas
- consider trade-offs. We are oriented toward simplicity and ease of use. It's OK to have a ton of code to support something if it "feels simple" for the user and is reliable and predictable and learnable.
- write in ./disucssions/multimedia.md the competitive research and trade-offs
- pick the best solution and go for it. 
- implement, test thoroughly
- validate
- add nice-to-haves. Such as "search" working for text via built-in OCR.

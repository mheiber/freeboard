clicking "esc close" on the main window doesn't close, it opens help. Expected behavior: should close


Also: clicking anywhere in Help should not close help. It's annoying when I miss a link and end up closing the whole thing.

The main Help page should have at the top left '<- Close help' and 'esc' should say 'close help' not 'close' (not sure about capitalization, do something consistent)

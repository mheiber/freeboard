I noticed an issue. The user goes to paste something and we open up the accessibility window. The user adds our app and sets the accessibility and then they go click to paste again. The paste doesn't actually go to their original window, it goes to the accessibility. Window. I think it might be better if we do something else, consider some options. Here's an example that we might do. An example we might do is to push back the accessibility window. I mean, push. Back system preferences, so it's further back in the list of windows. We could do this by refocusing on whatever window is next in the stack. If this doesn't make sense, don't do it.

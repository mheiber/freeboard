DO THIS ONE LAST


## Commit: keyboard shortcuts bar

Remove the Quit button. It's covered by Esc.
For Help follow the same format for other things. Should be ? Help . Make sure Esc is the last item
So it will look like **?** Help **Esc** close   (no asterisks, I'm just writing in Markdown here)
On the main scren, use the shift icon instead of the word "shift" but make the icon big so it's easy to see. This saves horizontal screen real estate

When pasting code and we detected the language, make it so  shift-paste can "paste formatted" and the functionality will paste with syntax highlighting. Use all our normal best practices: shows up in the shortcut hints at the bottom of the screen, i18n, a11y

add the i18n/a11y stuff to values if not already there, near where we talk about liveness

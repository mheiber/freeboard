Add right-click support for nearly editing entries, favoriting, expanding, anything else that seems useful and doesn't clog up the UI too much or Overwhelm the user. Take inspiration from Tmux's right-click context menu. It's beautiful and simple, and even though Tmux can do hundreds and hundreds of things, it usually only has six or seven entries in it at most. We may be able to get away with even fewer.

In a recent commit, you changed the way ctrl-n ctrl-p hints at the bottom of the main screen look. Make them look like they did before, I think it was ^n/^p

The two sides should be individually clickable, but that doesn't mean you should separate the text


Also: fix our shortcut hints everywhere. capital letters should not be used for things that don't involve shift because if someone see ctrl-E they might think it's ctrl-shift-e because of the capital and it's not. Fix everywhere.

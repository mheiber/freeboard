For screen cracks:

We're off to a great start, the cracks are beautiful and believable. Nice work.

The ones ending in 2B and 61 are not fit for our purposes, since they are mostly behind our content and just distract (due to opacity). Please replace with better ones.

Also: the user needs a preview. When they select a crack, open the window if it is not already open, so the user can see.

Ensure there is syntax highlighting for top 20 modern langauges. Do  not implement from scratch, use some trusted high-quality thing that will be familiar to vim users

ALSO: make sure OCaml works! You tried to add it before but I don't see any syntax highlighting for ocaml still.

You probably need better validation for this stuff - any way you can mock things out or expose functions for testing and see if the functions work?

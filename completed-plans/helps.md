in help:
- when there are no links, remove the stuff about how to navigate links, following our livenss principle from values.md. 
- in the help for settings, don't list out what the settings are and don't do a big logo thing. Just say "Right-click the [F] icon in the menu bar to access settings"
- the line going to the [F] menu bar is great, but it should originate from the literal "[F]" in the text in the help

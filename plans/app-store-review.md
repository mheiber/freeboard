DO THIS LAST


subagent 1: Pretend you're a GOOD well-intentioned but cranky app store reviewer. what are your questions and suggestions?

subagent 2: Pretend you're a GOOD well-intentioned but very LAZY app store reviewer and are prone to misunderstanding the app. share the misunderstandings

Both app store reviewers really care about our values but also about Apple and Apple users and human interface guidelines.

Add the  to plans/app_store_1_$NAME.md up to 10 plans. Then, as a lead engineer, implement them all in separate commits *if you agree with them* if not, update the plan with why you didn't do it and then commit that instead.

remember that once a plan is actioned it goes to completed-plans. once a plan is rejected it goes to rejected-plans
